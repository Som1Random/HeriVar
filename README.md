## Background

Heritability of a trait is often identified and reported in an ancestry group stratified manner. This limits the ability to estimate and report the combined heritability in a multi-ethnic population. Although there are several methods demonstrated recently with robust ways of calculating heritability with or without individual-level datasets, these methods are limited to ancestry-specific groups. In this project, we are proposing a way to calculate combined heritability using a multi-ethnic reference linkage-disequilibrium (LD) panel with equal proportions of data. We will use current existing tools to simulate and calculate heritability and report it as a framework that can be implemented and explored further. This will lead to the development of a novel approach to estimating the heritability of particular traits in multi-ethnic populations. As a part of Team HeriVar, you will be contributing to the demonstration of methodology, calculation of heritability, and work as a team to promote the method.

With the increasing availability of multi-ethnic whole genome sequence datasets, there is a gaping absence of an approach to estimate the heritability of particular phenotypic trait that accounts for the multi-ethnic genetic architecture. This approach of calculating the combined multi-ethnic heritability has not been pursued previously. This project helps us understand the problems facing this issue in the field of genomics and helps in generating a framework using existing tools to calculate and assess the heritability of a trait in multi-ethnic populations.
